# Data Analysis of Dangerous Driving

Analysis of Sentencing and Regional Differences for the Crime of Dangerous Driving: A Sample Based on First-instance Judgments in the Past Three Months

Final project of Introduction to Computation (C), 2022 Fall, Peking University

## Description

The topic is the statistical analysis and presentation of data from first-instance criminal judgments on the crime of dangerous driving. The process involves analyzing 1,708 first-instance judgments for cases labeled as 'the crime of dangerous driving' downloaded from [PKULAW](www.pkulaw.com) from September to November 2022, which are then saved into a file named data.csv. Afterward, the file is read to explore the relationships between various variables. The selected variables are: the province where the incident occurred, breathalyzer test results, the legal basis cited by the court, whether the defendant confessed, the suspect's sentence (suspended sentence, detention, or fixed-term imprisonment), and fines.
